                MILITARY HOUSING ASSISTANCE FUND (MHAF)
              </h1>
            </header>

            <h5>
              WE HELP WITH OUR CLOSING COST GIFTS FOR MILITARY MEMBERS AND
              VETERANS
            </h5>
            <p>
              MHAF is a program of the US Military that assists active military
              and veteran families by providing them opportunity of purchasing a
              home faster and less expensive. 69% of all Americans own their own
              home. Unfortunately, our men and women in uniform are being left
              behind. In a Rand Corporation study, it was found that only 27.3%
              of military families own their own home. In this same study, when
              asked why, nearly half said that it was because they could not
              afford to do so. That&apos;s why our program is designed to help
              cover some of the costs for our nation&apos;s heroes when they
              purchase a home.
            </p>

            <h5>HOUSING!</h5>
            <p>
              Generally, military housing is provided for all service members,
              whether they&apos;re living on or off base. There may be
              exceptions to this rule, which you can discuss with a recruiter.
              Otherwise, with the abundance of housing options, most service
              members will be able to find housing that fits their needs, this
              is where we come in as an intermediary.
            </p>

            <h5>LIVING ON BASE</h5>
            <p>
              Military housing varies by rank, location and family situation,
              but almost all new recruits typically start their military careers
              living on base.
            </p>
            <p>
              During Basic Training, men and women live in separate quarters
              known as barracks, which consist of shared bunks and bathroom
              facilities. Because service members are there for training,
              personal items are kept to a minimum and everything happens on a
              set schedule, allowing service members to focus on learning and
              working as a team.
            </p>

            <p>
              As service members move up in rank, they get better housing
              options to choose from, if available. Single service members can
              live in complexes that resemble a modern college dormitory, which
              could consist of a single or shared room and a shared living area,
              while more senior service members, or those who are married, can
              select from a variety of apartments and single-family homes.
            </p>

            <p>
              Military bases can be quite large and living on one is a lot like
              living in a town. There are post offices, shopping centers,
              medical and dental clinics, and other businesses. The base
              amenities are open to all resident service members and may be open
              to guests on a case-by-case basis.
            </p>

            <h5>GETTING A HOUSE UNDER THE HOUSING PROGRAM</h5>
            <p>
              Finding a new home can be an exciting experience, especially when
              you have the right resources to help you through the process.
              Military OneSource and your installation&apos;s housing office
              provides tools, referrals to services and personalized support to
              make your next move the best one yet.
            </p>

            <h5>GETTING STARTED</h5>
            <p>

              process of finding a place to live in your new location and
